Embedded Javascript templates

EJS(Embedded JavaScript templated) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup language with plain JavaScript.

It is somewhat like JSX(JavaScript XML) where it lets you write JavaScript in HTML type format. Something like this:

<ul>
	<% users.forEach(function(user){ %>
	<%- include(‘user/show’, {user: user});	%>
	<% }); %>
</ul>

In this example it is used to print a list in HTML using JavaScript syntax.

- express-fileupload

Used to upload files via express.js

- express-flash

This pakcgae is used so that flash messages can be used in the system.

- dotenv

This package is used to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

Q .(We could have simply used the .env file, so why we are using dotenv? Any advantages of that?)
